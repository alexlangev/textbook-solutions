# Check-yourself 1.6

1. a) It is stated that the PMD is limited by network performance. Adding an extra network channel reduces the delay to obtain network access. This in turn *indirectily* improves response time since while the program is not executed faster, the total time is reduced. Is this considered as a shorter *user time*? as for the throughput, it might be better if there is a queying of tasks due to limited network.

b) This is somewhat comparable to **a**. Instead of have more network channels, the network is now more efficient. I would say that response time is indirectly better and that and that is there is queying, the total throughput might be better.

c) As for having more memory, I am really not sure. I might have an impact on response time is the program has a bottleneck due to memory. 

2. see paper.

3. The answer is 9.9 sec so **b** is the correct formula.
