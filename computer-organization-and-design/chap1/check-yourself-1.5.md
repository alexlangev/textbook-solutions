# Check-yourself 1.5

1. This is true. The more volume going out for a single chip, the more reasonable it becomes to tweaks and optimize manufacturing processes to increase the yield. 

2. That is false. Designing a part is designing a part. The volume has no impact here.

3. That is very true. Masks but be in the hundreds of thousands if not milions. They are used for a single design and then can't be used anymore. The more chips you can print out, the less $$ per chip the mask costs.

4. This is true also. Same idea as the last point but instead of the mask cost it is the engineer's salaries.

5. This might be true. This is an uneducated guess but I am thinking that parts with small dies are easier to produce in high volume. This is due to the fact that more dies can be cut from the same waffer. By the same logic, less dies can be cut from a single waffer the bigger they are. 

As for volume compared to die size that is more an economic decision.
