# Check-yourself 1.5

- DRAM:
    It's fast but limited and relatively expensive. Computers nowadays range from 16gb to 64gb. The book states that the access time is about 50 nanoseconds. I wouldn't be surprised if it's even faster nowadays.
- Flash: 
    Flash has really replaced hard-drives in 2024 for most usecases. It's come down in price so much and is more dependable. We see anywhere from 250gb to 4tb in m.2 SSDs. These are slower than DRAM but can still be fast. Brave search mentions 40 to 100 micro seconds of access time.
- Disk storage:
    Disk is getting obsolete. Its slow compared to flash memory since it has to physically move to the correct piece of data. It also take considerable space so you don't see them in laptops anymore. I have a 8tb drive somewhere that I don't even use since it's slow. I bet you can buy 16tb hard drives for cheap nowadays. Brave search mentions 6 to 12 milliseconds of access time. This is slooooooow. That being said, the advantage I could see is for someone that needs to maximize size and doesn't care about speed.
