While I do believe this insight to be true, I think I am an outlier compared to most people. I have three main laptops and two older ones used as airgaped machines. I only own one television. I stay away from anything "smart". Meaning I don't buy "smart" appliances or gadgets. I tend to buy older cars. In the kitchen I prefer chopping by hand and using stainless steel and cast iron pans. While embedded processors still outnumber PCs, it's not as much as the average Canadian.

This question is a bit harder to answer this early in the book. Therefore this is a very uneducated guess from my part:

- Algorithms: When an applications is struggling with a seemingly simple task and when the hardwear is relatively powerful.

- The programming language: When an application has been optimized as much as possible and when the hardwear is already decently powerful.

- The operating system: This might not be the intended answer but I am thinking of bloat. Some linux distros can be very lean and easy to run on weaker and older hardwear. These will generally have less background processes running. You can also modify easily the amount of power different processes will use. Having an optimized program and hardwear that can't be improved either by age or budget, finding a more efficent OS can be a good solution.

- The processor: When needed raw processing power (more ghz) or when needing more CPU cores for parrallel processing, the CPU can be a good place to optimize.

- The I/O system and devices: Different motherboard can handle power delivery differently. I think this can bring marginal improvement on performance. Also, having different I/O might help. Monitor resolution and refresh rate does make a good impact on performance.
