#  chapter 4 exercise 3

```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
	total := 0

	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		total := total + 1
		fmt.Println(total)
	}
}
```

## Solution

The error comes from the use of the `:=` operator on line 7. By using the walrus operator instead of the normal assignment operator, the `total` variable is being shadowed in the for loop.
