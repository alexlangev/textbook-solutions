# Chapter 1 exercise 2

## Thoughts
These are somewhat open to interpretation. For instance, suspension bridge cable could be both dependability by redundancy and performance by parallelism.

## Solution

a. Assembly lines in automobile manufacturing <-> Performance via pipelining
b. Suspension bridge cables <-> Dependability by redundancy
c. Aircraft and marine navigation systems that incorporate wind information <-> Abstraction to simplify design
d. Express elevators in buildings <-> Make the common case fast
e. Library reserve desk <-> hierarchy of memories
f. Increasing the gate area on a CMOS transistor to decrease its switching time <-> Performance via parallelism
g. Building self-driving cars whose control systems partially rely on existing sensor systems already installed in the base of the vehicle (smart cruise control or lane assit) <-> Performance via prediction
