# Check yourself chap 1.1

## Exercise 1

While I agree with this statement in general, I am different than most people. I have three over 6 personal computers at home, multiple cell phones and multiple gaming consoles. Additionaly I stay away from IOT products at all cost. These product tend to break faster, cost more and be harder to repair.

## Exercise 2

- Algorithms: When trying to improve performance of an app, website or video game.
- Language and compiler: When coding performance critical programs. For instance some sort of log parser made for use in large scale enterprises.
- Operating system: I know by my own experience that you can bring an old personal computer back to life by installing Linux.
- The processor: When you need to use a specific piece of software to perform difficult tasks. For instance, 3d rendering with Blender. Upgrading a CPU can have a big impact.
- I/O system and devices: This one requires more creativity I think. I guess any type of real world simulations used in predicting natural phenomena like weather needs tons of data as input. Adding new sensors will most likel improve the precision of the task.
