# Exercise 1.1-4

## Solution

Both problems share similarities. The *shortest path* problem is somewhat baked-in the *traveling salesman* problem. 

The first is a problem that has efficient algorithms while the later has no know efficient algorithm (it's a NP-complete problem)
.

The *shortest path* is simpler since it only considers one truck. The *traveling-salesman* is not since it considers multiple trucks.
