# Exercise 1.1-3

## Solution

I have not spent much time learning data structures yet. With that in mind, let's look at **arrays**. I am thinking of **arrays** in **GO** specifically. 

Strengths:
- The value are ordered.
- It is conceptually simple and intuitive.

Limitations:
- The length of the array is fixed. To lengthen or shorten the array, a new array must be constructed. 
- I can't remember is they are considered immutable but I think so. Does this bring limitations? 
- Writing functions that take in arrays as argument are limited to one size of array only. Therefore multiple versions of the same function are needed to account for varying lengths. In real life programming tasks, this is somewhat limiting.
